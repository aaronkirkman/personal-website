Apart from the information GitHub inevitably collects, it does not contain any visitor analytics or tracking software.

# Google Fonts

For consistency across devices, Google Fonts is used to load the fonts on this page.
[Google says they do not track these requests](https://web.archive.org/web/20200426130508/https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq), but the site will still work if you block these fonts.
